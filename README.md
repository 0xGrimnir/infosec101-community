## Nerd Entertainment

I think it's fair to assume that most of us in the Information Technology, Computer Science, and Information Security industry are nerds. It's okay if you're not - but you're missing out! If you plan on hanging around the Information Security community very much at all, you'll quickly become acquainted with a term known as "Nerdcore." Even more quickly if you attend any of the conventions. No Information Security post would be complete without at least some sort of shout out to Nerdcore, and my Nerdcore friends YTCracker and Int80 (of Dual Core), and the many other talented Nerdcore artists out there.

I'll let you research this topic further, but I have to leave you with at least one link:

### [All the Things (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y), by [Dual Core](https://twitter.com/dualcoremusic).

Good luck out there in the community, hackers. Hack all the things (as long as you have permission to do so. ;))!
